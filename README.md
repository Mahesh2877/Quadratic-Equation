# Quadratic-Equation
Code to solve a quadratic equation.

A Quadratic Equation is of the form a.x^2 + b.x + c = 0
The solution for such an equation is given as x = (-b +/- (b^2 - 4.a.c)^.5)(2.a)
Given the values of a,b,c as input, this code attempts to solve for x and return its value as the output.
